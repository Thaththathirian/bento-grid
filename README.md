## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox
- CSS custom properties

### Challenges Faced

1. **Grid Alignment Issues**: Some sections were not aligning properly due to incorrect area assignments. I fixed this by refining `grid-template-areas`.
2. **Overlapping Elements**: Certain elements overlapped unexpectedly, which I solved by adjusting `grid-template-rows` and using `grid-template-columns` where necessary.

### Continued Development

In future projects, I plan to:

- Enhance responsiveness for different screen sizes.
- Experiment with more advanced CSS Grid techniques.
- Improve accessibility by considering ARIA roles and keyboard navigation.
